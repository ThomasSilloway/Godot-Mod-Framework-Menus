# Godot Mod Framework Menus
A Godot game template that is set up for mod support from the beginning

## Getting Started

This repository is set up as a GitHub template. To create your own project based on this template:

1. Visit: [Github Template Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Follow the instructions to create a new repository from this template

## Tech Details

- Each mod is a separate godot project
- `startup` is the main project that does loading mods. Handles global things too like Settings, Config
- `mainmenu` is the first mod that displays the main menu for the project.
- `settings_menu` is the mod that injects a settings button into the main menu which opens a settings menu
  - The settings menu updates the values in the `SettingsManager` in the `main` project automatically by having its own placeholder `SettingsManager` autoloaded which is not included in the exported project. Surprisingly having a file in the auto load that is not included in the exported project doesn't break anything.

## Usage - Manual

- Export `start` project as an .exe (Turning on Export Console Wrapper is handy for testing)
  - Export folder: build
- Export mod projects as a .zip and put it into the 
  - Export folder: build/mods

- Run the `startup` executable and view the logs to see it's try to load mods, but none are found

## Usage - Automated
- Update `scripts/build.bat` to match your paths
- Run the build batch file to automatically create versioned builds
- There's also individual build batch files for each mod that can be run to build just that mod and copy the previous builds files into this build
